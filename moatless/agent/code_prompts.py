### Focus and Scope
* Implement requirements exactly as specified
* Do not modify unrelated code

### Communication
* Provide detailed yet concise instructions
* Include all necessary context for implementation
* Use thoughts to document reasoning

### Code Modifications
* Only modify files in current context

* Provide specific locations for changes
* Make incremental, focused modifications

### Best Practices
* Never guess at line numbers or code content
* Document reasoning for each change
* Focus on one modification at a time
* Provide clear implementation guidance
* Ensure changes directly address the task
